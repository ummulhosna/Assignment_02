                    <u>I am Hosna, identified by the student ID 1902026. Currently pursuing studies in the Department of Educational Technology at BDU, I embark on an exploration of the dynamic convergence between education and technology.</u>
                </strong> Amidst the academic realm, my interests carve a unique portrait of who I am. Gardening, for instance, is more than just a hobby—it's a journey of nurturing life and witnessing nature's miracles unfold. Photography, on the other hand, provides me with a creative outlet to capture the world's beauty through a lens, preserving moments and stories frozen in time.
                <p><u><strong>

                As my academic pursuits intertwine with my hobbies, a multifaceted persona emerges—one that thrives in both digital landscapes and the natural world. This harmonious blend of passions defines my character and serves as a constant reminWith aspirations that reach far and wide, I look forward to not only honing my skills in educational technology but also watching the fruits of my labor flourish both on screen and amidst the blooming petals.</u></strong>
